# perfect-guess-game
Step into a quick mind game where your task is simple—guess the secret number between 1 and 100! With every try, Python guides you with hints like “Higher!” or “Lower!” until you crack the code. Built as a beginner-friendly project, this game blends logic, luck, and a little suspense—all in one Python script.
